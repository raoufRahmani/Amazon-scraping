    "\n",
    "3. **Go to page 2** of the product results\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Example: If you search for *AirPods*, there will be multiple pages (1, 2, 3...) in the end of the page\n",
    "   * Copy the link from the address bar while you're on **page 2**\n",
    "   * The copied link will end with something like `sr_pg_2`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Paste the edited link into the input field** Enter the url\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Enter the number of pages you want to scrape**\n",

    "\n",
    "   * The file will be created automatically in your working folder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, your file will contain product titles, prices, and the date of extraction â€” ready to be cleaned and analyzed.\n"
